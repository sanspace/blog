I had created my site and blog a [few years ago](https://sanspace.in/blog/hello-world) on my birthday. I started with a very cheap host that offered hosting at $1/mo. That comes with a price. Your site might go down at any time. That didn't bother me much at that time. Initially, my site contained a few static html pages while my blog was a wordpress site. I was happy with wordpress as it offered me a good looking blog with minimal configuration.

All these years there were a few times my site went down along with my blog. Everytime, I had to go through the painful ritual of looking for an outdated backup (the host didn't help) and set up the db for wordpress. However, I've matured a little as a developer all these years and I had to stop it. 

So, this time I did not go to a traditional host. I've decided to minimize cost while not compromising the uptime. As a github user, I'm entiteled to [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). I decided to give it a try. To my surprise, it was very easy. Verrrry easy!

Thanks to [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) for making this possible.
