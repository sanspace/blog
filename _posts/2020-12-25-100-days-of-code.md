**TL;DR**: I'm doing [100 Days of Code](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) starting today.

[Quincy](https://twitter.com/ossia) shared several links in this week's newsletter of his and one caught my attention. Though I've seen the hashtag on twitter a lot, I did not know the backstory. Here's the link from Quincy if you wanna read it yourself.

> The unlikely history of the 100 Days of Code Challenge, and why you should try it for your 2021 New Year's Resolution. (10 minute read): [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-crazy-history-of-the-100daysofcode-challenge-and-why-you-should-try-it-for-2018-6c89a76e298d/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-crazy-history-of-the-100daysofcode-challenge-and-why-you-should-try-it-for-2018-6c89a76e298d/)

I jump on these opportunities pretty quick üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and here I'm dusting off my blog after 5 years and drafting a post. I did [commit publicly](https://twitter.com/2sks/status/1342459102702669824) as a nudge for me to keep this up. I do not have a detailed plan yet. But, I am planning to dedicate an hour a day for some tech stuff even if it's not entirely coding. I'll keep you posted. 

If you wanna team up as I don't have my two partners for rule #2, please reach out. Thanks for reading!
